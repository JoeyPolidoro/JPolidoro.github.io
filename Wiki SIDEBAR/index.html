            <h1>Music</h1>
            <p>
                Music is generally defined as the art of arranging sound to create some combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm, or otherwise expressive content.<sup>[1][2][3]</sup> Definitions of music vary depending on culture,<sup>[4]</sup>though it is an aspect of all human societies and a cultural universal.<sup>[5]</sup> While scholars agree that music is defined by a few specific elements, there is no consensus on their precise definitions.<sup>[6]</sup> The creation of music is commonly divided into musical composition, musical improvisation, and musical performance,<sup>[7]</sup>though the topic itself extends into academic disciplines, criticism, philosophy, and psychology. Music may be performed or improvised using a vast range of instruments, including the human voice.

                In some musical contexts, a performance or composition may be to some extent improvised. For instance, in Hindustani classical music, the performer plays spontaneously while following a partially defined structure and using characteristic motifs. In modal jazz, the performers may take turns leading and responding while sharing a changing set of notes. In a free jazz context, there may be no structure whatsoever, with each performer acting at their discretion. Music may be deliberately composed to be unperformable or agglomerated electronically from many performances. Music is played in public and private areas, highlighted at events such as festivals, rock concerts, and orchestra performances, and heard incidentally as part of a score or soundtrack to a film, TV show, opera, or video game. Musical playback is the primary function of an MP3 player or CD player and a universal feature of radios and smartphones.

            <h3> Creation</h3>
            <p>
                Music often plays a key role in social activities, religious rituals, rite of passage ceremonies, celebrations, and cultural activities. The music industry includes songwriters, performers, sound engineers, producers, tour organizers, distributors of instruments, accessories, and sheet music. Compositions, performances, and recordings are assessed and evaluated by music critics, music journalists, and music scholars, as well as amateurs.

                The modern English word 'music' came into use in the 1630s.It is derived from a long line of successive precursors: the Old English 'musike' of the mid-13th century; the Old French musique of the 12th century; and the Latin mūsica. The Latin word itself derives from the Ancient Greek mousiké (technē)—μουσική (τέχνη)—literally meaning "(art) of the Muses". The Muses were nine deities in Ancient Greek mythology who presided over the arts and sciences. They were included in tales by the earliest Western authors, Homer and Hesiod,[15] and eventually came to be associated with music specifically.[14] Over time, Polyhymnia would reside over music more prominently than the other muses.[11] The Latin word musica was also the originator for both the Spanish música and French musique via spelling and linguistic adjustment, though other European terms were probably loanwords, including the Italian musica, German Musik, Dutch muziek, Norwegian musikk, Polish muzyka and Russian muzïka.<sup>[8]</sup>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                It is often debated as to what extent the origins of music will ever be understood,<sup>[23]</sup> and there are many competing theories that aim to explain it.<sup>[24]</sup> Many scholars highlight a relationship between the origin of music and the origin of language, and there is disagreement surrounding whether music developed before, after, or simultaneously with language.<sup>[25]</sup> A similar source of contention surrounds whether music was the intentional result of natural selection or was a byproduct spandrel of evolution.<sup>[25]</sup> The earliest influential theory was proposed by Charles Darwin in 1871, who stated that music arose as a form of sexual selection, perhaps via mating calls.[26] Darwin's original perspective has been heavily criticized for its inconsistencies with other sexual selection methods,[27] though many scholars in the 21st century have developed and promoted the theory.<sup>[28]</sup> Other theories include that music arose to assist in organizing labor, improving long-distance communication, benefiting communication with the divine, assisting in community cohesion or as a defense to scare off predators.<sup>[29]</sup>
